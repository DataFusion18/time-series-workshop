This workshop is targeted at scientists working in the marine and related areas who are using long-term
biological and environmental datasets to build understanding of ecosystem functioning and to apply that
knowledge within a management context. The workshop will serve as a forum to discuss current
statistical approaches to the analysis of such datasets and exchange ideas. The emphasis will be on
detecting step changes and potential regime shifts using state-space modelling.
